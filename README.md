# Maze-Runner---Unity

# Overview

As a software engineer, I've become increasingly interested in game development. This project is my first attempt at using Unity engine.

## Description
Maze Runner is a 2D game where players take control of a slime navigating through a maze. The slime is controlled by pointing in the desired direction, and a press of the spacebar propels it forward, somewhat akin to the mechanics in Flappy Bird. The objective is to maneuver through the maze without touching the walls. Colliding with the walls results in the player restarting at the beginning of the maze. The goal is to successfully navigate to the end of the maze.

## How to Play:
1. Point the slime in the desired direction.
2. Press the spacebar to make the slime bounce through the air.
3. Navigate through the maze without colliding with the walls.
4. If the slime touches a wall, it restarts at the beginning of the maze.
5. Reach the end of the maze to complete the game.

## Purpose:
The primary purpose of developing Maze Runner was to get some exposure to game design using a game engine. Through this project, I aimed to strengthen my problem-solving skills, learn more about game mechanics, and gain practical experience in creating an engaging user experience.

# Future Work

Since this was a quick project, there are other features that I would like to implement, along with enhancing some features already present.
* Create more levels
* Add checkpoints (pass a certain point and you start returning there when you die instead of the beginning) or safe zones (places that you can land without dying).
* Make it more visually appealing. Maybe add a background, or make the maze walls look different from the white rectangles that they are right now.
